# GameOfLife
Our project is based on the rules of Conway's Game of Life, using Java to complete the basic functions and Java Swing to implement the GUI. It handles a 100*100 size map and can automatically run after clicking the play button. It contains four default initial patterns to play with. We tried to separate the map to four parts as four threads to increase the compile speed.

# How to run
Please run the GOLParallel.java file under the folder "src/golparallel" to run the project.
